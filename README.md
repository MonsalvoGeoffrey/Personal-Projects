# A list of personal projects in random order

## Custom Programming Language
A practice project to learn how intepreters work (and maybe compiler if  I'm up for it)

## ChatGPT clone
I certainly don't have the computing power to even dream reaching ChatGPT's accuracy but just learning in more details how it works and how it can be tweaked should be great and fun

## Youtube summurizer
A firefox/chrome browser add-on using Whisper and ChatGPT 4 to write critical informations about a youtube video

## Stable Diffusion: No-Data Experiment
Buliding a Stable Diffusion clone, and attempt to train it with absolutely no pre-exisitng data (data generated by the model is fine)

## A Rimworld Mod
**No Royal Requirements**, disabling all room requirements for royal pawns as well as disabled work types.
Should include VFE Empire compatibility.

## Redo r/place to Stable Diffusion but with GPT-4V and DALL-E 3 instead
