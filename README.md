# A list of personal projects in random order

## Custom Programming Language
A practice project to learn how intepreters work (and maybe compiler if  I'm up for it)

## ChatGPT clone
I certainly don't have the computing power to even dream reaching ChatGPT's accuracy but just learning in more details how it works and how it can be tweaked should be great and fun

## Youtube summurizer
A firefox/chrome browser add-on using Whisper and ChatGPT 4 to write critical informations about a youtube video

## Stable Diffusion: No-Data Experiment
Buliding a Stable Diffusion clone, and attempt to train it with absolutely no pre-exisitng data (data generated by the model is fine)

## A Rimworld Mod
**No Royal Requirements**, disabling all room requirements for royal pawns as well as disabled work types.
Should include VFE Empire compatibility.

## Redo r/place to Stable Diffusion but with GPT-4V and DALL-E 3 instead

## Blockly to PyTorch
Revive the Blockly to PyTorch project
Alternatively, create a programmimng language meant to transpile to PyTorch

## Portfolio Website
Probably not the first thing to make, but a portfolio website could be cool to have

## DALL-E assistant
A website powered with ChatGPT-4V and DALL-E 3 to create presets and fine-tune in loop the images being generated to attempt to help in creating something great
Bonus points for doing this with open-source uncensored models instead, but I most certainly lack the computing power for this
Could be done with Electron since I mean for this to be a local app, this could be an occasion to learn Electron

## Pandemic Simulator
I mean the board game, making a simulator that could be ran multiple times to anylise best strategies

## Pathfinding algorithm visualizer
Probably with LOVE2D, I always struggled with the idea of making a visualizer for an algorhythm, and this is a good occasion to learn

## Slay The Spire mod using ChatGPT
And I don't mean using ChatGPT to make the mod, but using ChatGPT to generate cards on the fly, and perhaps even bosses and relics.

## Build a language that transpile to Brainfuck
Not sure how to go about it yet, but it's certain that control flow and functions are going to be a requirement there.

## Line Counting CLI tool
I occasionaly just wish to count how long in lines a file or group of file is, finally a project that I can do and actually use !
